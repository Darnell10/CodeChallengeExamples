Overall non-code specific notes:

1) No architecture.
I feel like architecture is a must if you want to have a real chance at getting a full-time job. All production code follows some sort of architecutre and you must show that you understand how to follow at least one of them.
2) No tests.
For any level above a junior position/intern level, I believe tests are a must. This is a continuation of point number 1 of architecture because a good architecture allows of easy testing and greater coverage.
3) Design did not follow Google's Material Design.
This isn't as important as the first 2 points, but shows that the user isn't well versed in Android. Every Android dev knows about Material Design and should be able to follow its implementation.
